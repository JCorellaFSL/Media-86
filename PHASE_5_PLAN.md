## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Specifications**

### **TypeScript Migration**
```typescript
// Complete type safety across the application
interface AppConfig {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';
  shortcuts: KeyboardShortcuts;
  performance: PerformanceConfig;
  metadata: MetadataConfig;
}

// Strict typing for all API calls
type TauriCommand<T = unknown> = {
  command: string;
  args: Record<string, unknown>;
  response: T;
};
```

### **Testing Strategy**
```typescript
// Comprehensive test coverage
TestingPyramid = {
  unit: "80% coverage - hooks, utilities, pure functions",
  integration: "Component interactions, context providers", 
  e2e: "Critical user journeys, file operations",
  visual: "UI regression testing with snapshots"
}
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
```typescript
// Real-time metrics collection
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  memoryUsage: MemoryInfo;
  cachePerformance: CacheStats;
  renderTimes: RenderMetrics;
  userInteractions: InteractionMetrics;
  errorTracking: ErrorMetrics;
}
```

### **Metadata System**
```typescript
// Rich image information display
interface ImageMetadata {
  basic: BasicInfo;      // dimensions, format, size
  exif: ExifData;       // camera settings, GPS
  performance: LoadMetrics; // load time, cache status
  ai?: AnalysisData;    // future: AI-based categorization
}
```
